> To clear this checkpoint is to speak in English and to write in the winding grace of traditional script — like a school of fish crowding to the water's skin just to breathe the air.
It is to cast a shark into the ocean without ever teaching it to swim, to wish for snow without first making the city cold, to mistake an airplane for a falling star, to take a blaze for a blessing.
One may pass the border of spring with ease, yet the perilous frontier of youth— that, no one truly crosses unharmed.
