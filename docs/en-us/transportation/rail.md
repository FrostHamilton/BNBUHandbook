# 🚉 Rail Transport

> Author: ShiJimmy

> [!WARNING]
> The so-called “speed-up packages” sold on third-party platforms (such as Ctrip, Qunar, etc.) are **completely useless**. Don’t waste your money – simply use the official 12306 standby ticket function.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If your previous train is delayed and you miss the following one, the railway authority is obliged to assist you in boarding another service to your destination. You may also request a full refund for any onward tickets at the counter.

> [!TIP]
> The “auto-booking” function on third-party platforms **can actually be useful**, especially when tickets are released at 5:00 a.m. and you’re still fast asleep.

## Guangzhu Intercity & Zhuhai Airport Intercity (C-series / S-series trains)
If you board at Tangjiawan Station, you can reach many popular spots in Zhuhai quickly and cheaply – such as Huanyu City (Qianshan Station), Gongbei/Gongbei Port (Zhuhai Station), Hengqin Port (Hengqin Station), Zhuhai Chimelong, and Zhuhai Airport. You can also travel to Guangzhou, Foshan, Zhongshan, and even change to other long-distance trains at Guangzhou South Station.

### Payment Methods

- Buy tickets via the official 12306 mobile app or the [12306 website](https://www.12306.cn); tickets are also available at station ticket machines, counters, and authorised agencies. <sup>[1]</sup>

- Use the “Railway e-Card” QR code within the 12306 mobile app. <sup>[2]</sup> <sup>[3]</sup>

- Use a China Railway Yintong stored-value card to enter through the gate. <sup>[4]</sup>

Notes:

1. Money-saving tip: If you are travelling on a C-series service between Guangzhou South and Tangjiawan, split your ticket at **Xiaolan Station** on the same train – you’ll save **5 yuan**.

2. Similar to tapping a QR code on the metro, you don’t need to pre-purchase a ticket. However, you must use the dedicated gates and tell the staff: “I want to use the Railway e-Card.”

3. Before using the e-Card on Guangzhu Intercity or Zhuhai Airport Intercity services, ensure your account balance is at least 70 yuan (even if your actual fare is only 10 yuan), otherwise you won’t be able to enter.

4. ~~The fact that this card is still around today is honestly a miracle.~~

### Long-distance Cross-line Trains (D-series / G-series)
These trains only stop at Zhuhai Station and Zhongshan Station – they **do not** stop at Tangjiawan.

If you’re setting off from BNBU and have **not yet bought a ticket**, it’s recommended to first take a C-series train from Tangjiawan to Guangzhou South, then change to a long-distance train. The choice is wider and usually cheaper.

If you’ve **already purchased** a long-distance ticket from Zhuhai Station, the most economical and hassle-free way is: take a C-series / S-series train from Tangjiawan to Zhuhai Station, then use the fast transfer passage at Zhuhai Station to go directly into the waiting hall for your long-distance train – no worries about traffic congestion.

#### Payment Methods
Tickets can be purchased via the official 12306 mobile app or the [12306 website](https://www.12306.cn); also available at station ticket machines, counters, or authorised agencies.
