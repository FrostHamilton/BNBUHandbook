# 🚉 Railway Transport

> [!WARNING]
> Acceleration packages sold by third-party platforms (such as Ctrip, Qunar, etc.) are **completely useless**. Please use the official 12306 standby ticket function instead – don’t waste your money.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If you miss a connecting train because the previous one was delayed, the railway authorities are responsible for helping you board another train to reach your destination. You can also request a full refund for the unused onward ticket at the counter.  

> [!TIP]  
> The auto-booking feature on third-party platforms **is useful**, especially when tickets are released at 05:00 in the morning and you don’t want to wake up early to grab them.  

## Guang–Zhu Intercity (C trains) and Zhu–Ji Intercity (S trains)  
From Tangjiawan Station, you can take these trains to reach many popular destinations in Zhuhai quickly and cheaply, such as Huanyu City (Qianshan Station), Gongbei / Gongbei Port (Zhuhai Station), Hengqin Port (Hengqin Station), Zhuhai Chimelong, Zhuhai Airport, etc. You can also travel to Guangzhou, Foshan, Zhongshan, and transfer to other trains at Guangzhou South Station.  

### Payment Methods  

- Purchase tickets via the 12306 mobile app or the [12306 official website](https://www.12306.cn). Tickets are also available at station ticket machines, ticket counters, and authorised ticket agents <sup>[1]</sup>.  

- Use the 12306 mobile app’s **Railway e-Card travel code** <sup>[2]</sup> <sup>[3]</sup>.  

- Use a **China Railway Yintong Card** to tap in at the gates <sup>[4]</sup>.

Notes:  

1. To save money: if you’re travelling on a C train between Guangzhou South Station and Tangjiawan Station, buy tickets in two sections (split at **Xiaolan Station**) for the same service – you can save **5 RMB**.  

2. Works like scanning a QR code for the metro. No paper ticket required. At the station, you must use a dedicated gate – tell staff “I want to use the Railway e-Card”.  

3. Before using the Railway e-Card for Guang–Zhu or Zhu–Ji Intercity trains, make sure your balance is no less than 70 RMB (even if the fare is only 10 RMB). Otherwise, you won’t be able to enter the station.  

4. The S-train short shuttle service (Zhuhai–Zhuhai North) on the Guang–Zhu Intercity was withdrawn from service on 1 July 2025.

## Long-distance D / G Trains  
These services only stop at Zhuhai Station and Zhongshan Station. They **do not stop** at Tangjiawan Station.  

If you are departing from BNBU and **haven’t bought your ticket yet**, it is recommended to first take a C train from Tangjiawan Station to Guangzhou South Station and transfer to a long-distance train there. There are more choices and fares are cheaper.  

If you **already hold a ticket** departing from Zhuhai Station, the most time-efficient and traffic-free method is: take a C train from Tangjiawan Station to Zhuhai Station, then use the fast transfer passage at Zhuhai Station to enter the waiting hall for your long-distance train.  

### Payment Methods  
As before, tickets can be purchased via the 12306 mobile app, the [12306 official website](https://www.12306.cn), station ticket machines, ticket counters, or authorised agents.
