## A Long's Northeast BBQ *6 / 10 points*

::: info Opening Hours / Address / Average Price
Afternoon - 2:00 AM | 2011 Jin Tong Road, Xiangzhou District, Zhuhai | Average 60-120 RMB per person
:::

The BBQ prices are relatively reasonable compared to the southern regions, but honestly, they're not great by Northeast standards. It turns out the owner‚Äôs wife is from Liaoning, so it was hard for her to hold back.

This place is a popular spot for team-building, located right across from the school and next to Lost. The menu is quite diverse (a moment of silence for the now-defunct A Long‚Äôs BBQ). The quality control is fairly solid, as you can see the staff skewering the ingredients themselves instead of using pre-made materials. The editor enjoys the honey-glazed grilled chicken and cheese sweet potatoes (though I think they might be gone now?), and the dumpling soup is also pretty good. However, the dumplings are just regular frozen ones, so that's a no-go.

They‚Äôre open until 2:00 AM at the latest, but you can call ahead if you want them to stay open a little longer.

## BNBU Phase 1 & Phase 2 Snack Street *6 / 10 points*

It‚Äôs like panning for gold in the sand‚Äîyou can enjoy a good meal here even for a quick bite. The burger stall, where they make fresh burgers and hot dogs on the spot, comes highly recommended! There's also a hidden gem with steaks, which you can pre-order for a delicious meal.

Inside Phase 1, there's an elderly gentleman who makes a really good beef noodle soup. The editor has also had the pleasure of enjoying his "smoked" rationed food. At the same time, there's a little cocktail shop run by a very chatty owner, and his bartending skills are quite impressive. Many people enjoy sitting there, chatting and sipping drinks.

## Wang Jie‚Äôs Farmhouse *7 / 10 points*

::: info Address / Price per Person
No. 4, Lane 2, Huitong Village, Jintong Road, Xiangzhou District, Zhuhai | Around ¬•100 per person
:::

A fairly authentic Northeastern-style iron pot stew, located in Huitong Village near BNBU.

I first tried it before the restaurant moved to Huitong Village, when a senior took me there. Later, I also brought some Northeastern friends, and they really enjoyed it. The iron pot stewed goose is especially fragrant, and it‚Äôs perfect for a group of 3‚Äì6 people.

The value for money is excellent ‚Äî you can eat very well for under ¬•100 per person.

## Huitong Shanshui Farmhouse *7 / 10 points*

::: info Address / Price per Person
No. 120, Huitong Road, Huitong Community, Jinding, Zhuhai (opposite Beijing Normal University Affiliated Foreign Language School) | Around ¬•80‚Äì150 per person
:::

The rating is below 8 mainly because of the interior d√©cor rather than the food quality. Its advantage is the location ‚Äî right across from the school, so you can drop by anytime. Private rooms are also available. The overall style is rustic farmhouse, which might appeal to traditional Cantonese diners (perhaps?).

Recommended dishes include free-range chicken and claypot rice, both classic farmhouse flavors! The price per person is quite reasonable at around ¬•80‚Äì150, making it suitable for gatherings of three or more people.

## Chao Ji Claypot Rice *7 / 10 points*

::: info Hours / Address / Price per Person
11:00‚Äì14:15, 17:30‚Äì20:15 | No. 58, Jinfeng Middle Road, Jinding, Zhuhai (at the police station intersection) | Around ¬•20‚Äì40 per person
:::

If you want to try authentic Cantonese-style claypot rice from a true local eatery, this spot near Jinding Market is a must.

The freshly cooked rice, drizzled with soy sauce, brings out the full aroma of the vegetables and preserved meats. Paired with soup and herbal tea, it makes for a complete experience.

The d√©cor is that of a typical small Cantonese eatery, with very affordable prices at ¬•20‚Äì40 per person.

## Xueyuan Shanghai Restaurant *8 / 10 points*

::: info Hours / Address / Price per Person
11:00‚Äì21:00 | Building 6, Gangwan No.1, Gangwan Avenue, Tangjia Town, Zhuhai | Around ¬•100‚Äì150 per person
:::

As a Shanghainese, I really found the taste of home here ‚Äî the authentic Shanghai flavors are not to be missed. The Gangwan No.1 location has a more modern Shanghainese-style d√©cor, unlike some other places that still feel like 1990s restaurants, making it a better spot for photos too.

Their ‚ÄúYan Du Xian‚Äù (pork and bamboo shoot soup) is excellent, especially in winter when you can taste the fresh winter bamboo shoots in the broth. Overall, the dishes are very authentic, though the flavor profile may not suit everyone‚Äôs palate.
